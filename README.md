[Fortitudo et misericordiam](https://translate.google.co.uk/?ie=UTF-8&hl=en&client=tw-ob#en/la/Strength%20and%20kindness)

A friendly and inquisitive chap who gets a little too excited about troubleshooting.  
I've had awesome careers in the Luxury and Creative sectors and am not scared of new challenges or of failing.  
Looking for an electric team of hardworking devs that I can be a part of and learn from, ideally with exposure to full-stack but mainly in a front-end role using CSS, AngularJS and my experience as a 3D artist.

####Learned to learn

Something

- Passed every weekend challenge [Like stickers?]()  
- Blogged about my experience and development at Makers every day [Blog](http://sanjsanj.github.io)  
- I am the Git master [Github](http://www.github.com/sanjsanj)  
- Do you know a coach at Makers?  Please ask them about me

####Not a CS graduate

You won't have to wait 6 months for me to unlearn all the outdated dogma that is drilled in to a CS grad, or for me to actually be able to contribute to a team, or for me to learn how to learn myself, or to get some life experience.
