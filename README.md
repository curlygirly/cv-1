[*Fortitudo et misericordiam* - Strength and kindness](https://translate.google.co.uk/?ie=UTF-8&hl=en&client=tw-ob#en/la/Strength%20and%20kindness)

<img align="left" src="public/myFace_withMargin.jpg" width="172px">
 A friendly and inquisitive chap who gets a little too excited about troubleshooting and is happy to take on client-facing roles.  
I've had awesome careers in the Luxury and Creative sectors and I'm not scared of new challenges or failing.  
Looking for an electric team of hardworking devs that I can be a part of and learn from, ideally with exposure to full-stack but mainly in a front-end role using CSS, AngularJS and my experience as a 3D artist.

##Skills

####Learned to learn

I feel privileged to have spent the last 12 weeks at Makers Academy with the most intense, passionate and driven people I have ever met.  It pushed me further than I ever thought I could go and has given me many new life-long friends.  It's also introduced me to new opportunities like volunteering as a coach at [Codebar.io](http://www.codebar.io/)

- Completed [every weekend challenge](public/week12_stickers.JPG), using Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, JQuery, AngularJS, HTML, CSS and more, all test-driven and pair-programmed  
- I'm a [Git addict](http://www.github.com/sanjsanj) with over a thousand commits and a hundred-day streak  
- Blogged about my experience and [personal development at Makers every day](http://sanjsanj.github.io)

####Not a CS graduate

Because I haven't got an evil Computer Sciences degree you won't have to wait 6 months for me to;

- Unlearn 3 years of mostly superceded dogma and no real-world experience  
- Contribute immediately with practical knowledge of researching, designing, testing, developing, debugging and deploying  
- Learn how to learn myself so I can migrate to whatever languages and frameworks a task requires

####Animation and post-production

Self-taught designer with over 150k downloads on the iTunes app store, a long list of clients for my design work and a LinkedIn profile with [strong recommendations](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanjaypurswani#recommendations) over the last 4 years.  My main tools are [Cinema 4d](http://www.maxon.net/products/cinema-4d-studio/who-should-use-it.html), [After Effects](http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/aftereffects.html) and a billion industry-standard plugins.

- My general [3d motion graphics showreel](http://www.designsanj.com)  
- My last big project before Makers, [music video breakdown reel](https://vimeo.com/119332812?from=outro-embed)
