 A friendly and inquisitive chap who gets a little too excited about troubleshooting.  
I've had awesome careers in the Luxury and Creative sectors and am not scared of new challenges or of failing.  
Looking for an electric team of hardworking devs that I can be a part of and learn from, ideally with exposure to full-stack but mainly in a front-end role using CSS, AngularJS and my experience as a 3D artist.  I'm very good with clients and am happy to work closely with them.

####Learned to learn

Something

- Passed every [weekend challenge]()  
- I am the [Git master](http://www.github.com/sanjsanj)  
- Blogged about my experience and [personal development at Makers every day](http://sanjsanj.github.io)

####Not a CS graduate

Because I haven't got an evil Computer Sciences degree you won't have to wait 6 months for me to;

- Unlearn 3 years of mostly superceded dogma with no real-world experience  
- Contribute immediately with practical knowledge of researching, designing, testing, developing, debugging and deploying  
- Learn how to learn myself

####Animation and post-production

Self-taught designer with 150k downloads on the iTunes app store, a long list of clients for my design work and a LinkedIn profile with [strong recommendations](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanjaypurswani#recommendations) over the last 4 years.

- My general [3d motion graphics showreel](http://www.designsanj.com)  
- My last big project before Makers, [music video breakdown reel](https://vimeo.com/119332812?from=outro-embed)
